      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>Hello World! I don't really care to talk about myself but I guess I will for a project. I am Emilio and I like long walks on beaches - I am just kidding. I will be serious even though I am not a serious person.<br><br>

        Anyway, I am not entirely new to programming with Javascript because I have dabbled with creating websites in the past. I fell in love with coding around 4 years ago when I was given the opportunity to build a website for a plumbing company using Wix, which is one of those drag and drop website builders, and using that was extremely frustrating so I decided to build the website from scratch. I became obsessed with learning to code websites. I stopped coding websites entirely because I had a failing relationship to deal with as well as dealing with finding out my daughter had brain cancer. My daughter is cancer free and has been cancer free for 3 years now. <br><br>I am picking up learning how to code again and one of my main projects is a web app that teaches music theory. My passions are programming and music so I decided to mix the two. Check out my projects to see the skills
        that I've learned with Flatiron combined with self studies. </p>
